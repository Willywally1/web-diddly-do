		<p> This website highlights the effect of our day to day lives on the environment and how y'all are
			fucking it up.
			Inhabitants of those environments live there for a reason, so you don't come home to a polar bear routing through
			your freezer for fish fingers. Unsustainable deforestation for timber in the rainforests, you want an orangutang to
			come steal your sofabed because it needs a nap, that wood used to be it's bed, now your fat ass is watching
			Eastenders on it. Unsustainable argiculture, you'd be livid if a pig was doing open surgery on your nan because it
			wanted to make an onion and kidney pie, are you kidding me? </p>
